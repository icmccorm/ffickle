We began with a snapshot of the crates.io database taken on 12/20/2022, which contained `r fc(total)` crates. From this population, `r fc(passed_early)` passed the early linting stage, while `r fc(failed_early)` failed. Of those that passed the early linting stage, `r fc(passed_late)` passed the late linting stage, while `r fc(failed_late)` failed. After removing crates without valid versions from the late linting stage, we are left with
